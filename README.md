# COMP6000-FinalProject

The project leverages JSP and MySQL database to create a directory of businesses. This system accounts for three different users:
* Consumers
* Business Owners
* Administrators

The privileges for each type of user are listed below.

## Consumers
Consumers are the casual browsers of the site. They can choose to browse through business information. Additionally, they are able to apply to become a new business owner
on the website and have their business information displayed.

## Business Owners
Business owners have the ability login to their business account and view the information related to their business.

## Administrators
Administrators are able to login to their accounts and approve, or deny, the applications of prospective business owners. Once an application is approved, the information
pertaining to that business is displayed on the directory home page.
